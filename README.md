Number Utility Toolkit (C++)

A menu-driven C++ console application that performs various mathematical and number-theory operations.
This project is designed and built in progressive levels, showcasing a structured learning approach from basics to advanced concepts.

📌 Level 1 – Basic Number Operations (Completed ✅)

This level focuses on fundamental programming concepts and basic problem solving.

Features implemented:

  [1]  Check if a number is Even or Odd
  [2]  Check if a number is Prime
  [3]  Check if a number is a Palindrome
  [4]  Check if a number is a Perfect Number
  [5]  Reverse a number
  [6]  Find Sum of Digits
  [7] Check if a number is an Armstrong Number
  [8]  Find Factors of a number
  [9] Generate Fibonacci Series
  [10]  Compute GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
  [11]  Compute LCM (Least Common Multiple)

Concepts used:

  [1]  Functions and function declarations
  [2] Conditional statements
  [3] Loops
  [4] Vectors (std::vector)
  [5] Menu-driven program design
  [6] Basic mathematical logic

🚀 Level 2 – Optimization & Code Quality (Planned 🔧)

This level focuses on improving efficiency, structure, and readability.

Planned improvements:

  [1] Optimize factorization using sqrt(n)
  [2] Improve Fibonacci logic (limit by value instead of count)
  [3] Use long long for large numbers
  [4] Handle invalid inputs gracefully
  [5] Replace pow() with integer-safe calculations
  [6] Separate logic into utility/helper functions
  [7] Better naming conventions and comments

 Concepts to be introduced:

  [1] Time complexity analysis
  [2] Modular code design
  [3] Input validation
  [4] Cleaner function abstractions

🔥 Level 3 – Advanced & Professional Features (Future Scope 🌱)

  [1] This level aims to make the project resume-ready and industry-aligned.

  [2] Planned enhancements:

    [1] Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
    [2] Create a NumberUtils class
    [3] Encapsulate all operations as class methods
    [4] Support for multiple inputs in one run
    [5] Add unit-like test cases (manual validation)
    [6] File handling to log results
    [7] Command-line argument support
    [8] Better user interface formatting
    [9] Extend to handle very large numbers
    [10] Prepare the project for competitive programming & interviews

  Advanced concepts involved:

    [1] Classes & Objects
    [2]  Encapsulation
    [3]  Clean architecture
    [4]  Scalability planning
    [5]  Professional project structuring
